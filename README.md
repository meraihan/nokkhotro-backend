This is the sub module of proshomon project. 

SAJIDA Foundation began in 1987 as a small garage school for disadvantaged children and since then, we have grown from strength to strength, learning with each step. Today, we offer a diverse portfolio of microcredit products alongside quality healthcare services and various social development programs for six million patrons, working across 22 districts, with a dedicated team of 3,538 caring change makers.

We are a non-profit organization dedicated to our raison d’etre of bringing health, happiness and dignity for all. Over the last 25 years, SAJIDA has taken great strides to bring about meaningful and sustainable change, which are defined by our values of family first, innovation and quality, dignity, equality, inclusiveness, empowerment of women, compassion, empathy, transparency and accountability.

As SAJIDA forges ahead with innovative and quality interventions for people from all strata of the society, we stand committed to always staying true to the values that define us. We carry forward our Founder Syed Humayun Kabir’s legacy of reaching out to those in need, not as an act of charity, but as part of our responsibility.
